Hi! This is an implementation of a traveling trip schedule for one person using classes in Python.

There are 3 classes utilized to make this happen:

1.) Date class:
 - Implements calendar dates occurring on or after January 1, 1800.
 - An instance input includes a month, day, and year.

2.) Trip class:
 - Keeps track of a travel schedule for a person.
 - An instance includes a destination, departure date, and duration of travel.
 - Uses the Date class to implement the departure date.

3.) TripSchedule class:
 - Stores a collection of trips that form the trip schedule for one person.
 - Can perform various methods on the trips in the collection.
 - Uses the Trip class to create and add trips to the schedule.
